SQL TERMS
------------------

DISTINCT - eliminates duplicate data returned from a SQL query.

NULL - the absence of a value. Behaves differently from nil in Ruby as it is not 'falsy' and only returns itself in operations. Even NULL = NULL returns NULL.

WHERE - filters rows. (Use original language)

HAVING - filters groups. (Use original language)
